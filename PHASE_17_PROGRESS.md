# Phase 17: Test Suite Stabilization - Summary

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** 🚧 **IN PROGRESS** - Root cause identified, partial fix applied  
**Duration:** ~1 hour (ongoing)

---

## 🎯 Overview

Phase 17 was initiated to fix critical test failures (77% failure rate) and stabilize the test suite before continuing with documentation and other improvements.

---

## 📊 Current Status

### Test Results - Before Phase 17
```
✅ Passing: 489 tests (23%)
❌ Failing: 1,658 tests (77%)
⚠️ Errors: 27 test errors
📝 Total: 2,147 tests across 118 files
```

### Test Results - After Partial Fix
```
✅ Passing: 504 tests (23%)
❌ Failing: 1,918 tests (79%)
⚠️ Errors: 15 test errors
📝 Total: 2,422 tests across 119 files
```

**Improvement:** +15 tests passing
**New Issue:** DOM environment not loading (document is not defined)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: `vi.mocked()` Compatibility

**Problem:** The test suite uses `vi.mocked()` which is not available in Vitest 1.4.0.

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// Failing test code
vi.mocked(useCreateResume).mockReturnValue({...})
// Error: vi.mocked is not a function
```

**Root Cause:** `vi.mocked()` was introduced in later versions of Vitest. The project uses Vitest 1.4.0, which doesn't have this function.

**Occurrences:** Found in 169 locations across 29 test files.

---

## 🔧 Actions Taken

### 1. Added `vi.mocked()` Polyfill ✅

**File:** `vitest.setup.ts`

```typescript
// Add vi.mocked helper for compatibility
if (!("mocked" in vi)) {
  // @ts-expect-error - Adding missing mocked function
  vi.mocked = function mocked<T>(fn: T): T {
    return fn as T
  }
}
```

**Status:** Added but ineffective (setup runs after test file imports)

### 2. Automated Replacement Script ⚠️

**File:** `fix-vi-mocked.mjs`

Created Node.js script to replace all `vi.mocked()` calls with `(mockFunction as any)` casts.

**Results:**
- ✅ Successfully replaced 169 occurrences across 29 files
- ❌ Regex was too greedy and broke some patterns
- ⚠️ Need to improve regex to handle nested parentheses correctly

**Issues Found:**
```typescript
// Bad replacement examples:
createMockResume({ id: "new-id" })(apiClient.post)  // Wrong!
Error("Failed to create resume")(apiClient.post)    // Wrong!
```

The regex `vi\.mocked\(([^)]+)\)` matched up to the first `)` it found, breaking function calls with nested parentheses.

---

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### 1. Version Compatibility Issues
- Always check library version compatibility
- `vi.mocked()` is a newer Vitest feature
- Polyfills must run before test imports

### 2. Regex Complexity
- Simple regex patterns fail with nested structures
- Need proper AST-based transformations for code modifications
- Consider using `jscodeshift` or similar tools for code transformations

### 3. Test Suite Health
- 77% failure rate indicates systemic issues
- Root cause analysis is critical before attempting fixes
- Automated fixes require careful validation

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Short Term)

1. **Fix Regex Pattern** ⏳
   - Use proper balanced parenthesis matching
   - OR use AST-based transformation (jscodeshift)
   - Validate each replacement

2. **Alternative Approach: Direct Mocking** ⏳
   Instead of replacing `vi.mocked()`, refactor tests to use direct mocking:
   
   ```typescript
   // Before (doesn't work)
   vi.mocked(useCreateResume).mockReturnValue({...})
   
   // After (works)
   (useCreateResume as jest.Mock).mockReturnValue({...})
   // OR
   (useCreateResume as ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>).mockReturnValue({...})
   ```

3. **Consider Vitest Upgrade** 🤔
   - Check if upgrading Vitest would solve the issue
   - Review breaking changes in newer versions
   - Test in isolated environment first

### Strategic Decisions

**Option A: Fix Current Tests** (Recommended)
- ✅ No dependency changes
- ✅ Learn the codebase better
- ❌ Time-consuming manual fixes
- **Est. Time:** 4-6 hours

**Option B: Upgrade Vitest**
- ✅ Might fix vi.mocked() issue
- ❌ Risk of breaking changes
- ❌ May introduce new issues
- **Est. Time:** 2-3 hours + testing

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Fix critical test infrastructure first
- Then decide on upgrade vs. fix
- **Est. Time:** 1-2 hours analysis + 3-4 hours implementation

## 📂 Files Modified

### Created
- `PHASE_17_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive phase planning
- `fix-vi-mocked.mjs` - Automated replacement script (needs improvement)

### Modified
- `vitest.setup.ts` - Added vi.mocked() polyfill (ineffective)
- `src/setupTests.ts` - Added mocked helper (ineffective)

### Test Files Affected (169 replacements in 29 files)
```
src/routes/__tests__/settings.test.tsx
src/routes/__tests__/login.test.tsx
src/routes/__tests__/dashboard.test.tsx
src/lib/api/mock.test.ts
src/stores/__tests__/auth-store.test.ts

## 🚧 Blockers

### Critical Blocker: Broken Test Replacements
- Automated script broke test files
- Need to revert and apply better solution
- **Impact:** Cannot proceed until fixed

### Secondary Issues
- Dialog/Modal rendering issues (separate from vi.mocked issue)
- Missing test providers in some tests
- Async state management issues

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate (This Session)
1. ❌ **Pause automated fixes** - Manual review needed
2. ✅ **Document findings** - Create detailed analysis (this document)
3. ⏳ **Plan next approach** - Choose between Options A, B, or C

### Short Term (Next Session)
1. Implement chosen solution (A, B, or C)
2. Validate fixes with subset of tests
3. Apply to full test suite
4. Verify CI/CD pipeline

### Long Term
1. Add pre-commit hooks to catch version incompatibilities
2. Document testing patterns and best practices
3. Create test utility library for common patterns
4. Set up test health monitoring

## 🎓 Technical Insights

### Why vi.mocked() Exists
`vi.mocked()` is a type-safe helper that provides better TypeScript support for mocked functions:

```typescript
// Without vi.mocked() - lose type safety
const mock = useCreateResume as jest.Mock
mock.mockReturnValue({...}) // No type checking

// With vi.mocked() - type-safe
const mock = vi.mocked(useCreateResume)
mock.mockReturnValue({...}) // Type-checked return value
```

### Workarounds for Older Vitest

**Option 1: Manual Cast**
```typescript
(useCreateResume as any).mockReturnValue({...})
```

**Option 2: Type-safe Cast**
```typescript
(useCreateResume as ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>).mockReturnValue({...})
```

**Option 3: Custom Helper**
```typescript
function mocked<T>(fn: T): T { return fn }
// Use: mocked(useCreateResume).mockReturnValue({...})
```

## 🔄 Phase Status

**Phase 17 Status:** 🚧 **PAUSED FOR STRATEGIC PLANNING**

**Reason:** Automated fix attempt revealed complexity requires more careful approach

**Next Action:** Choose and implement solution strategy (Options A, B, or C)

**Estimated Completion:** 
- If Option A (Fix Tests): 4-6 hours
- If Option B (Upgrade): 2-3 hours + validation
- If Option C (Hybrid): 4-5 hours total
