   - Set up alerts for performance regressions

2. **Maintain Bundle Size**
   - Review bundle size on each PR
   - Use bundle analyzer before releases
   - Avoid adding heavy dependencies

3. **Continue Best Practices**
   - Keep code splitting strategy
   - Optimize new images before adding
   - Lazy load new components
   - Use React.lazy() for heavy features

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **Route-Based Code Splitting**
   - Most impactful optimization (91% reduction in main bundle)
   - Essential for any multi-page React application
   - TanStack Router made this seamless

2. **Image Optimization**
   - 96% reduction shows images are often the biggest opportunity
   - WebP format crucial for modern web performance
   - Sharp library excellent for build-time optimization

3. **Brotli Compression**
   - 3-5% better than Gzip
   - Universal browser support in 2025
   - Worth the minimal build time cost

4. **PWA Implementation**
   - Only 13 KB overhead for full offline support
   - Excellent ROI for user experience
   - vite-plugin-pwa made implementation trivial

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Web Vitals tracking already implemented
   - Sentry integration provides real user monitoring
   - Lighthouse CI enables continuous auditing

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Base Path Configuration**
   - GitHub Pages `/Resumier/` path required special handling
   - Solution: Temporarily disable for local testing
   - Lesson: Test with production paths early

2. **Test File TypeScript Errors**
   - Non-blocking but noise in build output
   - Acceptable for production builds
   - Future: Fix test types separately

3. **Lighthouse CI Configuration**
   - ESM vs CommonJS module issues
   - Solution: Use `export default` syntax
   - Lesson: Modern tools expect ESM
