/**
 * Accessibility Tests for Routes
 * Tests that route tree is properly configured for accessibility

 * - Route tree structure exists
 * - Routes have proper IDs for navigation
 * - Main route components pass accessibility checks in isolation

/**
 * NOTE ON FULL ROUTE TESTING:
 *
 * Full route rendering tests require:
 * - Complex router and query client setup
 * - Mocking localStorage, window, and other browser APIs
 * - Component-level mocking of all dependencies
 *
 * Instead, we test individual route components in isolation in other test files:
 * - navigation.test.tsx tests RootLayout (header, skip link, landmarks)
 * - forms.test.tsx tests LoginForm route component
 * - dialogs.test.tsx tests dialog route interactions
 *
 * For manual route accessibility testing, see:
 * - PHASE_19.2_KEYBOARD_TESTING.md
 * - PHASE_19.4_SCREEN_READER_GUIDE.md
