# Phase 11 Mutation UI Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive mutation UI components from Phase 10's API hooks, providing a complete user interface for CRUD operations on resumes.

## Components Created

### 1. Mutation Dialogs (`src/components/features/resume/mutations/`)

#### **CreateResumeDialog**
- Purpose: Create new resume with title input
- Features:
  - Dialog form with validation
  - Loading states during creation
  - Error handling with toast notifications
  - Success callback for navigation
  - Creates resume with default empty content structure
- Integration: Uses `useCreateResume` hook from Phase 10

#### **DeleteResumeDialog**
- Purpose: Delete existing resume with confirmation
- Features:
  - AlertDialog for destructive action confirmation
  - Shows resume title in confirmation message
  - Loading states during deletion
  - Error handling with toast notifications
  - Success callback for cleanup
- Integration: Uses `useDeleteResume` hook from Phase 10

#### **RenameResumeDialog**
- Purpose: Update resume title
- Features:
  - Dialog form with current title pre-filled
  - Validation (required, non-empty)
  - Only saves if title changed
  - Loading states during update
  - Error handling with toast notifications
- Integration: Uses `useUpdateResume` hook from Phase 10

### 2. Supporting Components

#### **AlertDialog** (`src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx`)
- Complete shadcn/ui AlertDialog implementation
- Components: AlertDialog, AlertDialogTrigger, AlertDialogContent, AlertDialogHeader, AlertDialogFooter, AlertDialogTitle, AlertDialogDescription, AlertDialogAction, AlertDialogCancel
- Uses @radix-ui/react-alert-dialog
- Styled with Tailwind and proper animations

#### **useToast** (`src/hooks/use-toast.ts`)
- Toast notification system
- Features:
  - Toast queue with limit (3 toasts)
  - Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
  - Support for default and destructive variants
  - Programmatic toast management (add, update, dismiss, remove)
  - React hooks-based state management

### 3. Enhanced Resume Dashboard

Updated `resume-dashboard.tsx` with:
- **Card Actions Dropdown**:
  - Hidden by default, shows on hover
  - Rename option
  - Delete option (red/destructive styling)
- **Improved Create Button**:
  - Uses CreateResumeDialog
  - Custom trigger with dashed border card
  - Plus icon SVG with accessibility attributes
- **Better UX**:
  - Hover effects on cards
  - Shadow on hover
  - Responsive grid layout (250px min width)
  - Updated timestamps
  - Proper keyboard accessibility

## Dependencies Added
- `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog@1.1.15` - AlertDialog primitive
- Previously installed: `@radix-ui/react-slot` - Slot primitive for composable components

## Integration Points

### Phase 10 API Hooks
All mutation components integrate with Phase 10's React Query hooks:
- `useCreateResume()` - Create new resume
- `useUpdateResume()` - Update resume (title or content)
- `useDeleteResume()` - Delete resume

### Benefits of Phase 10 Integration
- ✅ Optimistic updates (UI updates immediately)
- ✅ Automatic query invalidation (lists refresh after mutations)
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Type-safe mutations

## UI/UX Improvements

### Before:
- Simple card grid with basic "New Resume" button
- No way to delete resumes from dashboard
- No way to rename resumes
- onCreateResume callback required from parent

### After:
- Rich card UI with hover actions
- Dropdown menu for rename/delete on each card
- Modal dialogs for all mutations
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Self-contained component (handles its own create flow)
- Proper loading and error states
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
