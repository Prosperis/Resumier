## üí° Testing Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Close Your Eyes**
   - Simulate visual impairment
   - Rely only on audio feedback
   - Note when you get confused

2. **Test Real User Flows**
   - Complete entire task (e.g., create resume)
   - Don't just Tab through page
   - Try to accomplish actual goals

3. **Listen for Redundancy**
   - Are things announced twice?
   - Are decorative elements announced?
   - Is there too much verbosity?

4. **Check Context**
   - Can you understand without seeing?
   - Do button labels make sense?
   - Is navigation clear?

5. **Test Error States**
   - Trigger validation errors
   - Verify errors are announced
   - Check error recovery

### Common Pitfalls

‚ùå **Decorative icons not hidden**
```tsx
<Icon className="mr-2" /> {/* Will be announced */}
```

‚úÖ **Proper implementation**
```tsx
<Icon className="mr-2" aria-hidden="true" />
```

‚ùå **Missing button labels**
```tsx
<Button><X /></Button> {/* Just announces "button" */}
```

‚úÖ **Proper implementation**
```tsx
<Button aria-label="Close"><X aria-hidden="true" /></Button>
```

‚ùå **Errors not announced**
```tsx
{error && <div>{error}</div>} {/* Silent error */}
```

‚úÖ **Proper implementation**
```tsx
{error && <div role="alert" aria-live="assertive">{error}</div>}
```
