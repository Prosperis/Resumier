# Phase 19.9: Automated Accessibility Tests - Status

## Current Status: BLOCKED

### Issue
All Vitest tests are failing with `ReferenceError: document is not defined`, indicating the jsdom environment is not being initialized properly.

### What We Accomplished
1. ✅ Installed dependencies:
   - `vitest-axe@0.1.0`
   - `axe-core@4.11.0`

2. ✅ Created comprehensive accessibility testing utilities (`src/test/accessibility-utils.tsx`):
   - `configureAxe()` with WCAG 2.1 AA rules enabled
   - `expectNoAccessibilityViolations()` wrapper for axe integration
   - `testFocusManagement()` helper
   - `testAriaAttributes()` helper
   - Pre-built accessibility test patterns

3. ✅ Created test suites:
   - `routes.test.tsx` - Route tree structure verification
   - `forms.test.tsx` - LoginForm accessibility (10+ tests for aria-invalid, aria-describedby, focus, validation)
   - `dialogs.test.tsx` - Dialog accessibility (15+ tests for create/rename/delete dialogs, ARIA, focus trap)
   - `navigation.test.tsx` - RootLayout accessibility (20+ tests for skip link, landmarks, theme toggle, keyboard nav)

### Blocking Issue

**ALL tests in the codebase are failing** with the same error:

```
ReferenceError: document is not defined
  at render (node_modules/@testing-library/react/dist/pure.js:239:19)
```

This affects:
- ❌ New accessibility tests (src/test/accessibility/*)
- ❌ Existing component tests (src/components/ui/__tests__/*)
- ❌ All other test suites

### Possible Causes

1. **Vitest Configuration Issue**:
   - `vitest.config.ts` sets `environment: "jsdom"`
   - `setupFiles` includes `vitest.setup.ts` and `src/setupTests.ts`
   - But jsdom may not be initializing before test execution

2. **Bun Runtime Issue**:
   - Bun v1.3.0 may have compatibility issues with vitest + jsdom
   - Recent Bun update could have broken jsdom initialization

3. **Dependency Conflict**:
   - Recent dependency installation (vitest-axe, axe-core) may have caused version conflicts
   - @testing-library/react may need jsdom setup that's missing

4. **Setup File Order**:
   - vitest.setup.ts manually sets up indexedDB polyfills
   - May be interfering with jsdom initialization

### Next Steps (To Fix)

1. **Verify jsdom is installed**:
   ```bash
   bun list | grep jsdom
   ```

2. **Try explicit jsdom import in setup**:
   Add to `vitest.setup.ts`:
   ```ts
   import 'jsdom-global/register'
   ```

3. **Check Bun compatibility**:
   ```bash
   bun --version
   bun test --help | grep environment
   ```

4. **Revert to working state if necessary**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff package.json
   # If needed: git restore package.json && bun install
   ```

5. **Alternative: Use Node instead of Bun for tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test  # or npx vitest
   ```

6. **Check vitest versions**:
   ```bash
   bun list | grep vitest
   ```

### Test Files Created (Ready to Run Once Fixed)

#### routes.test.tsx
- Basic route tree structure verification
- No rendering tests (too complex without full router setup)
- Verifies route tree can be imported
- Documents manual testing approach

#### forms.test.tsx
```
- LoginForm accessibility violations (axe)
- Field labels properly associated
- Accessible submit button
- aria-invalid on validation errors
- aria-describedby for error messages
- Loading state announcements
- Dynamic aria-invalid clearing
- Required field marking
- No redundant ARIA labels
- role=alert for errors
```

#### dialogs.test.tsx
```
CreateResumeDialog:
- No violations when closed/open
- Proper dialog role and ARIA
- Accessible form fields
- aria-invalid on validation
- aria-describedby for errors
- Accessible action buttons

RenameResumeDialog:
- No violations when open
- Proper dialog ARIA
- Pre-filled accessible input

DeleteResumeDialog:
- No violations
- alertdialog role
- Accessible action buttons

Focus Management:
- Focus first input when opening
- Restore focus when closing

Icon Accessibility:
- Decorative icons hidden from screen readers
```

#### navigation.test.tsx
```
RootLayout:
- No violations
- Skip link as first focusable
- Accessible logo link
- Accessible theme toggle
- Proper landmarks (banner, main, navigation)
- Accessible navigation

Skip Link:
- Moves focus to main content
- Visible focus state

Button Accessibility:
- All icon buttons have aria-label
- Descriptive button text/labels

Link Accessibility:
- All links have accessible names

Icon Accessibility:
- Decorative icons use aria-hidden

Keyboard Navigation:
- No positive tabindex values
- Logical focus order

Dynamic Theme Button:
- Updates aria-label when theme changes

Interactive Element Patterns:
- Buttons use <button> or role
- Links use <a> or role
```

### Test Coverage

When fixed, these tests will verify:
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (via axe-core rules)
- ✅ ARIA attribute correctness
- ✅ Focus management patterns
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Error handling accessibility
- ✅ Form accessibility
- ✅ Dialog accessibility
- ✅ Landmark structure
- ✅ Skip link functionality
- ✅ Icon accessibility

### Estimated Completion

- **Fixing test environment**: 1-2 hours (investigation + fix)
- **Running/fixing tests**: 30-60 minutes (once environment works)
- **Total Phase 19.9**: Currently at 30% → Target 100%

### Impact on Phase 19

This blocking issue affects:
- **Phase 19.9**: Cannot proceed with automated testing
- **Phase 19.10**: Will need automated tests passing before final audit
- **Phase 19.11**: Documentation depends on test results

However, manual testing (Phases 19.2, 19.4) can proceed independently.

### Recommendation

**User should investigate the test environment issue** as this is a critical blocker affecting the entire test suite, not just accessibility tests. This may require:
- Checking recent changes to dependencies
- Reviewing Bun/Vitest compatibility
- Potentially rolling back recent updates
- Or switching to Node for running tests

Once fixed, the accessibility tests are ready to run and should provide comprehensive automated WCAG compliance verification.
